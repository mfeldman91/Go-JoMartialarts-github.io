      <p>
        Hello my Name is Sensei Michael Feldman. I began my martial arts journey at the age of 21 when I joined Dragon's Den MMA, a renowned karate and jiu-jitsu school led by the esteemed Professor Allan Bernstein. During my training at Dragon's Den, I had the honor of not only mastering various martial arts disciplines but also had the privilege of sharing my knowledge by teaching at several prestigious martial arts schools. From Dragons Den MMA to Academy For Martial Arts, Morose Martial Arts, Title Boxing, and Lou's Extreme Fight Club, I found joy in imparting the wisdom of martial arts to aspiring students.</p>

<p>After dedicating myself to training under Professor Bernstein for 4 to 5 years, I proudly achieved a black belt in kempo karate and a blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Eager to expand my expertise, I embarked on a transformative journey to Thailand, where I immersed myself in the art of Muay Thai on the serene island of Phuket. The training not only honed my Muay Thai skills but also provided the perfect environment to further develop my jiujitsu and boxing techniques. Before returning to the United States, I challenged myself by competing in a professional Muay Thai fight, solidifying the knowledge I had gained through relentless effort and dedication.</p>

<p>Back in the States, I pursued my passion for boxing, dedicating myself to intense training that ultimately allowed me to participate in the prestigious Golden Gloves competitions. Soon after relocating to Florida, I had the opportunity to share my expertise by teaching martial arts at Championship Martial Arts, a local chain of schools focusing on sport karate. Fueled by a desire to create a program that catered to students of all ages and skill levels, I embarked on a new venture, establishing a platform that nurtures and empowers individuals through martial arts. Throughout my illustrious career, I have assimilated a diverse array of styles and techniques, fostering not only my martial prowess but also enhancing my overall confidence and character.</p>

<p>To keep my skills fresh and continue pushing myself, I regularly competed in grappling tournaments all over the northeast, consistently winning gold or at least placing in the top 3 in every tournament. This ongoing commitment to competition has not only helped me refine my abilities but also fueled my passion for martial arts and the pursuit of excellence.</p>
